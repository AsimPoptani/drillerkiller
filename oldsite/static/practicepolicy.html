<h2>Our Practice Policy</h2>


        <p>Our practice aims to provide
            dental care of a consistent quality, for all patients. We have
            management systems to help us and which define each practice member's
            responsibilities when looking after you.</p>

        <p>In proposing treatment we will take account of your
            wishes. We will explain options where appropriate and costs, so that you
            can make an informed choice. We will always explain what we are
            doing.</p>

        <p>We will do all we can to look after your health. We
            will ask you about your general health, and about any medicines being
            taken. This helps us to treat you safely. We keep information about you
            confidential.</p>

        <p>Contamination control is also essential to the safety
            of our patients. Every practice member receives training in practice
            systems for contamination control.</p>

        <p>We screen all patients for mouth cancer at routine
            checkups. We ask patients about tobacco and alcohol use because they
            increase your oral cancer risk.</p>

        <p>Practice working methods are reviewed regularly at
            meetings of all staff. We encourage all staff to make suggestions to
            improving the care we give patients.</p>

        <p>We regularly ask patients for their views on our
            services. We have systems for dealing promptly with patient complaints
            and for insuring that lessons are learnt from any mistakes that we
            make.</p>

        <p>All dentists in the practice take part in continuing
            professional education, meeting the general dental council's
            requirements.We aim to keep up- to - date with current thinking on
            all aspects of general dentistry, including preventative care which
            reduces your need for treatment.</p>

    <p>All staff joining the practice are given training in
        practice-wide procedures. Once a year,there is an individual review of
        training needs for everyone in the practice.</p>

        <p>All members of the practice know of the need to
            ensure the dentists are working safely . We have systems to ensure that
            concerns are investigated and, if necessary, acted upon.</p>
