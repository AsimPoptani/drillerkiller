    In the early 1990's Jeremy Beadle was filming his series of &quot;Beadles
    About&quot;. One of his scripts was about a temporary dental assistant
    / helper<em> who was set up by Beadle's team.</em></p>
<p><em>The production team approached me to film this episode
    at my surgery and this is what happened. I provided the dental technical
    advice for this gag.</em></p>
<p><em>The episode was dubbed &quot;DRILLER KILLER&quot;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>        
<p><em>When I set up my domain the choice was obvious &quot;DRILLER
    KILLLER&quot;. I have been known as the &quot;DRILLER KILLER&quot; ever
    since!</em></p>
